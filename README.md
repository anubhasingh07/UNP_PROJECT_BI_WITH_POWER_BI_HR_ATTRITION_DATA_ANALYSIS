# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_HR_ATTRITION_DATA_ANALYSIS

I have completed a Power BI project in collaboration with UNP Education with real-world employee data. It was done using HR Attrition dataset which consists of employess level data like employee ID, age, gender, department, job role, monthly income, years at company etc. The name of my project is HR attrition and Workforce Analytics. The objective of the project is to understand why employee leave the company and to help take a better actions to keep employee engaged, satisfied and working with the company for a longer time. The project involved data cleaning, transforming which includes removing the null points or empty fields and creating some new columns, and building a structured data model. This will simply the calculations , KPIs and attrition rate analysis. I created DAX measures to calculate KPIs such as attrition rate, average age, average income, years at company etc. Interactive dashboards such as employee analysis, attrition analysis, demographic analysis and department level analysis were designed to analyze attrition by department, job role, salary slab, overtime, and demographic factors. Comparative analysis was performed to understand the impact of job satisfaction, work-life balance, and tenure on turnover. The findings showed higher attrition among employees with shorter tenure, overtime exposure, and lower salary levels. This project strengthened my skills in data claening and transforming, data modeling, DAX measures and dashboard design using Power BI.
